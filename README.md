# Weather Dashboard

## Overview
A lightweight weather dashboard that lets you search any city and view:
- Current conditions with temperature, feels-like, wind speed, and a weather icon.
- A 3-day forecast with min/max temperatures and small icons.
- A unit toggle to switch temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

No API keys required (powered by open-meteo.com).

## Setup
- Download index.html and open it in any modern browser.
- Internet connection is required to fetch weather data.

## Usage
- Enter a city name (e.g., "Berlin") and click Search or press Enter.
- Toggle between °C and °F using the control in the header.
- Current weather appears first, with the 3-day forecast below it.

## Improvements in Round 2
- Added a 3-day forecast section beneath the current weather.
- Introduced a temperature unit toggle (Celsius/Fahrenheit) affecting both current and forecast temperatures.
- Displayed small weather icons for both current conditions and each forecast day.
